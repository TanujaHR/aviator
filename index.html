	<h2>KNOW MORE ABOUT EAGLE</h2>
	<h3>EAGLE KINGDOM</h3></div>
		<div style="background-color:lightblue;color:black;">
		<p>Eagle is the common name for many large birds of prey of the family Accipitridae. Eagles belong to several 
		groups of genera, not all of which are closely related. Most of the 60 species of eagle are from Eurasia and Africa. 
		Outside this area, just 14 species can be found—2 in North America, 9 in Central and South America, and 3 in Australia.</p>
		<p>Eagles are large, powerfully built birds of prey, with heavy heads and beaks. Even the smallest eagles, such as the booted eagle<sub> (Aquila pennata)</sub>, 
		which is comparable in size to a common buzzard<sub> (Buteo buteo)</sub> or red-tailed hawk <sub>(B. jamaicensis)</sub>, have relatively longer and more evenly broad wings,
		 and more direct, faster flight – despite the reduced size of aerodynamic feathers. Most eagles are larger than any other raptors apart from some vultures. 
		The smallest species of eagle is the South Nicobar serpent eagle<sub>(Spilornis klossi)</sub>, at 450 g (0.99 lb) and 40 cm (16 in). The largest species are discussed below. 
		Like all birds of prey, eagles have very large, hooked beaks for ripping flesh from their<span style="background-color:orange;border:1px;color:purple;"> prey, strong, muscular legs, and powerful talons.</span> 
		The beak is typically heavier than that of most other birds of prey. Eagles' eyes are extremely powerful. It is estimated that the martial eagle, 
		whose eye is more than twice as long as a human eye, has a visual acuity 3.0 to 3.6 times that of humans. 
		This acuity enables eagles to spot potential prey from a very long distance. This keen eyesight is primarily attributed to their extremely large pupils which 
		ensure minimal diffraction<sup> (scattering)</sup> of the incoming light. The female of all known species of eagles is larger than the male.</p>
			<p> The snake and serpent eagles of the genera <ins>Circaetus, Terathopius, and Spilornis</ins> predominantly prey on the great diversity
			 of snakes found in the tropics of Africa and Asia. The eagles of the genus Aquila are often the top birds of prey in open habitats,
			 taking almost any medium-sized vertebrate they can catch. Where Aquila eagles are absent, other eagles, such as the buteonine black-chested buzzard-eagle of
			 South America, may assume the position of top raptorial predator in open areas. Many other eagles, including the species-rich genus Spizaetus, 
			 live predominantly in woodlands and forest. These eagles often target various arboreal or ground-dwelling mammals and birds,
 			 which are often unsuspectingly ambushed in such dense, knotty environments. Hunting techniques differ among the species and genera,
			 with some individual eagles having engaged in quite varied techniques based their environment and prey at any given time. 
			 Most eagles grab prey without landing and take flight with it,<del> so the prey can be carried to a perch </del>and torn apart.</p></div>
